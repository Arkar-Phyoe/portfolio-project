              The story is set in Salem, Massachusetts. The town is known for
              the witch hangings in 1692. That's why it's often called the
              "Witch City". Megan and Kelly have recently moved here with their
              parents. Now it is late October and Halloween is approaching.
              Megan, Kelly and their classmates are very excited. They prepare
              costumes and decorations. Then they look for a place to celebrate.
              The children decide to visit one of the Salem Witch Museums for
              inspiration. In the museum something strange happens. Megan sees a
              scary old lady, even though the museum attendant assures her that
              the children are the only visitors. In the end the friends find an
              abandoned house near the cemetery and decide to have a Halloween
              party there. But the party turns out to be much scarier than they
              could ever imagine.

              Davy Crockett is a legendary personality for the United States of
              America. This is the first hero of this country, who lived when
              America just came into existence. Davy proved himself to be an
              excellent scout, hunter and politician. Davy refused the
              opportunity to build a brilliant career in the Congress and went
              to Texas. There he helped Americans: men and women. He became the
              hero of the Alamo. The courage and strong spirit of this amazing
              officer changed the history of the country. Davy died, defending
              the fortress in Alamo. It happened during the War for Independence
              of Texas. Nowadays you can find a lot of books and movies about
              this man. Even our children can learn more about the great person
              thanks to the fascinating book.

              Zorro is a popular super hero from Spanish California. He was a
              foxy and clever revenger, who fought for justice. He wore a mask
              and a hat, was dressed in black clothes, and was armed with a
              sword and a whip. Zorro travelled by a black horse and wherever he
              was, he left a mark by three hits of the sword. Of course, his
              friends were honest poor natives, and his enemies were dishonest
              rich men. Sergeant Pedro Gonzales and his soldiers considered
              Zorro as a criminal and a bandit and wanted to catch him. Once at
              the February stormy night, the soldiers sat in a tavern and
              Sergeant Pedro talked to Don Diego that he could easily kill a
              terrorist Zorro in a fight. When Don Diego went home, Zorro came
              into the tavern and gave a chance to Sergeant to show that his
              words cost something.

            <p class="card-content">
              Through the examples of Paul, Paul's mother, and Uncle Oscar, the
              story illustrates the idea that greed for money makes people
              unhappy and ultimately inhumane. Every time Paul's mother reaches
              one financial goal, more distant, unattainable goals appear.
